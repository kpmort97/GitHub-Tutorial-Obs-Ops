# GitHub-Tutorial-Obs-Ops
This is an experimental repository to allow Rubin team members to test git commands in preparation for documentation.

The goal of this repository is to do the following:

1. Connect to a remote repository through terminal commands on a local computer.

2. Create a .txt file using a text editor (e.g., VSCode) and add the following criteria to it:

    -  Full Name
    
    -  Current Date
    
    -  Occupation at Rubin Observatory
    
    -  Favorite Git Command
    
3. Commit the changes into your local depository and push them upstream to the remote repository.

4. Create a pull request. Make sure to add a description and kpmort97 as a reviewer.

5. Once Pull Request is approved, check to make sure your branch is up-to-date. Out of date branches will have the following response: __"This branch is out-of-date with the base branch."__ If this occurs, rebase your branch IN TERMINAL.

6. Squash multiple commits, if more than one exists, and merge the files into the main repository.

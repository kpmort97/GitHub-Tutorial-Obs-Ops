# GitHub-Tutorial-Obs-Ops
This is an experimental repository to allow Rubin team members to test git commands in preparation for documentation.

The goal of this repository is to do the following:

(1)  Connect to a remote repository through terminal commands on a local computer.

(2)  Create a .txt file on VSCode and add the following criteria to it:

    -  Full Name
    
    -  Current Date
    
    -  Occupation at Rubin Observatory
    
    -  Favorite Git Command
    
(3)  Commit the changes into your local depository and push them upstream to the remote repository.

(4)  Create a pull request.

(5)  Merge the file into the main repository.
